# LExGo (Library Extension for Go)

LExGo is a library extension for Go. It provides a set of useful functions, algorithms and data structures that are not included in the standard library. It's composed of several packages:

- `tau`: (t)ype-(a)gnostic (u)tilities; provides a set of interfaces and functions that can be used with any type.
- `list`: provides implementations for the `List` interface defined in `tau`.
- `table`: provides implementations for the `Map` interface defined in `tau`.
- `tree`: provides implementations for the `Tree` interface defined in `tau`.
- `deque`: provides implementations for the `Deque` interface defined in `tau`.
- `algo`: provides a set of widely used algorithms.
- `errs`: provides a set of error types used in the library.
